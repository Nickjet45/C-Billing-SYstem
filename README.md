Program's Purpose: Concept Billing System
    
    Reason: Increase knowledge of C++ data structures and pointers
    
    Function: A concept billing system, that allows user's to add bill's to said system, and the monthly cost of each bill.
              The system will then emulate 2 months passing, and ask the user how much money they would like to pay
              After the user has stated how much they will pay, it will subtract that from the outstanding balance
              And tell the user how much money they still owe
